# The Mindfulness Bell #

The Mindfulness Bell rings periodically during the day, to give you the opportunity to hold on for a moment and consider what you are currently doing, in what state of mind you are, and how you currently approach whatever you are currently doing. The concept was proposed by Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh; taking a moment to breath in and out consciously and be aware of the present moment supports a mindful life. This simple implementation for Android 1.6 and newer can be configured to ring at a certain frequency, during your daytime only.
